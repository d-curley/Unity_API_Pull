# Unity_API_Pull
Pull JSON data from any API into unity. Great for IoT incorporation in game design

I have been using this to pull data from my Particle Photon to influence my Unity Apps. 

Tutorial incoming!

Credit to Turbo Makes Games for teaching me how to do this; I essentially took their tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIxu8kA9EBU) and modified slightly to use with Particle devices.
